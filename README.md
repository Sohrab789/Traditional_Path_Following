# Path Following for Nomoto 1st Order Dynamics with LOS Guidance and PID Controller
Path Following for Nomoto 1st Order Dynamics with LOS Guidance and PID Controller.
This repository demonstrates path following for various trajectories (Straight Line, Circle, Figure Eight, and random paths) using the Nomoto 1st Order Dynamics model with Line-of-Sight (LOS) guidance and a PID Controller. It is useful for simulating maritime navigation or any other dynamic systems that follow paths using similar control algorithms.

Features
Path Types: Straight Line, Circle, Figure Eight, and Random Paths
Dynamics: Nomoto 1st Order Model
Guidance: Line-of-Sight (LOS) Algorithm
Controller: PID Controller for Steering
Visualization: Plotting results for clear path following demonstration

How It Works
The repository simulates a vessel following different paths with the following components:

Nomoto 1st Order Dynamics: Models the system dynamics.
LOS Guidance Algorithm: Provides heading commands to keep the vessel on course.
PID Controller: Corrects steering errors based on the LOS commands.
